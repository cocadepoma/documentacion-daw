                The games are arranged in chronological order. The visual tour begins with the launch titles of the console, <strong>Killzone, Knack</strong>, etc, and it shows us the immense amount of great games available for the console: <strong>Uncharted
                4, The Last of Us 2, God of War, Astro Bot</strong>. .. The list is very, very long.</p>
            <p>Taking a general look at all of them and, especially, at the latest titles released on the market, from the aforementioned <strong>The Last of Us 2 to Ghost of Tsushima</strong>, it is amazing to realize what the <strong>Sony</strong> machine
                has achieved graphically and technical, with <strong>hardware from 10 years ago</strong>.</p>

            <p>SASS is an acronym for <strong>Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets</strong>, and refers to a style sheet preprocessor that gives powers to the <strong>static CSS language</strong>, turning it into a scripting language. Thanks to SASS we have
                variables, control statements and functions among other features, which are intended to be written without repeating themselves and <strong>reusing as much code as possible</strong>.</p>
            <p>To begin with, we will say that <strong>there are two versions of SASS</strong>, the old one (with a <strong>.sass</strong> extension) that used indentation to separate the blocks, and the new one, which uses curly braces just like the standard
                CSS syntax (with a <strong>.scss</strong> extension), b and lo which is much more familiar and is what we are going to see in this video.</p>

            <h3>Finally comes the USB cable that never gets tangled</h3>
            <p>We still can't live without them, but they are a nightmare when they get tangled up. <strong>Magnetic USB cables</strong> are the solution to avoid this inconvenience.</p>

            <p><strong>Murphy's Law</strong> tells us that when we put two perfectly bent and separated cables in a drawer, when we open it again they <strong>will be infinitely entangled</strong> with each other. And if it's just a cable, when you use it
                again it will have a knot. Science cannot explain this phenomenon, but it has happened to all of us. luckily, <strong>there is a solution</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>SuperCalla</strong> is a USB cable that <strong>never gets tangled</strong>. It has caught our attention because of its intelligent design, because it seems that it does what it promises. How does SuperCalla ensure that the USB cable
                never gets tangled? The key lies in the <strong>ring-shaped magnets strategically placed</strong> along its entire surface.</p>
