Hi, good evening.
My name is Paco and for this speech, I chose in my opinion, a very controversial topic, Social Networks.
First I would like to say some interesting facts.
In the Earth, we live around seven thousand six hundred millions of people. 
At this moment Facebook has about two thousand four hundred fifty millions of users,
YouTube nearly two thousand, WhatsApp: one thousand six hundred, Instagram one thousand...

The problem is that we post everything, our holidays, our birthday party,
the place where we are having lunch or whoever we are and
the question is: Is this dangerous? Yes, a lot because our information 
is sold to advertising companies, who send to us a lot of banner ads and videos
to attract our attention or to change our mind.
In addition, thieves may know if we are are or not in home.

Finally, I would like to say that the social networks have good things like 
stay connected with people wherever we are or getting some fresh news.
To finish my presentation I must ask you something, do you like social networks?

Thank you very much for your attention
Any questions?
